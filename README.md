# Welcome to CSE 455 (Computer Vision) Spring 2020!

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different homework assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed. Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/UW-CSE-455-2020SP/homeworks
cd homeworks
make
```

and check to see that everything compiles correctly. Then, to get started, open up the README for homework 0 in src/hw0/README.md, or view it [here](https://github.com/UW-CSE-455-2020SP/homeworks/src/hw0/README.md). Good luck and have fun!
